Accompanying code for "Active Localization of Gas Leaks using Fluid Simulation"

Based on Jos Stam's paper Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games and its implementation found here:
https://github.com/topaz1008/canvas-fluid-solver

Simulates the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids.

Tested with python 3.6.8

Required libraries:
pip3 install scipy==1.0.0 numpy==1.16.0 matplotlib==3.1.2 h5py==2.10.0
